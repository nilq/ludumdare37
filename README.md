- In North Korea
- Old-school computer stuff
- You need coffee : something like ... Two lines of code = need more coffee
- You need to keep coffee farm and code

All you've got's a room with a computer hooked up to North Korean internet ...
you've also got a square meter of farm and some coffee seeds

### Computer ...

You've got computer with a bad - very bad - NOrth Korean programming language
family friendly .. so .. baby Assembly or something ...

You need to find out wut's happening where you're at etc. etc.
damn .. thus:

- simple filesystem
- bad terminal commands : much broken
- bad, simple interpreted language
- .. yes

Idea shit

- Justice

  One room with growing population ...
  you must keep justice and farm sheep.

  You're a man ...

- Farming

  One room ... rather tiny room ... something
  You need to survive and farm sheep and potatoes

  Sit in one room and hack the world ...

  Like in TIS-100, weird, bad programming language
  unknown stuff with computer and filesystem etc.

  Make coffee ...

  Mr. Robot things ...
